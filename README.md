# wolakR
A random assortment of R functions and data that I often use. Arranged as an R package.


## To obtain nadiv:
 * From GitHub:
   * clone or download the latest development version here
   * install the latest development version directly in R using the `devtools` [package](https://github.com/hadley/devtools):
   ```R
   library(devtools)
   install_github("matthewwolak/wolakR")
   ```
